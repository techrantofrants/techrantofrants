Read or interact with the [rants](./rants/rants.md)

## How to contribute your rant(s)
1. open an issue with descriptive title and content (this is where 
people can interact with the author of your specific rant)
2. **TODO** find out best way and where to add the rant 
example:
- use markdown
- format: [title](./rants/all/your-rant-descriptive-name.md) - [issue](link-to-issue)
- tag?

- check the [sample rant](./all/test-rant.md)

you can:
- create the a rant file with your whole rant and link to it
- create the a rant file with a description and link to your rant, issue, etc
- create a rant issue (if there is no blog post, no rant file, etc)
- link to a gist
- whatever, but check that the links are working and follow [please read the code of conduct before participating.](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  

- create the rant file with your-rant-descriptive-name.md
- link it in rants/all/all.md
3. send a PR
4. wait
5. **FIX-ME** (where?) link to your rant (your-rant-descriptive-name.md)
6. enjoy
